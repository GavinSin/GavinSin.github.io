These are especially true when people use both of the words interchangeably. One key thing to keep in mind:
Comparing API and Web Service is like comparing Fruit and Apple. While all apples are a kind of fruit, not all fruits are apples.
Definitions API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user interaction.</description></item></channel></rss>
